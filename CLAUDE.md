- While working through a set of tasks, prefix your output with emojis, so I can quickly see how it's going. For newly found issues or when you run into a problem, use the warning emoji. When something has succeeded or is going positive, use the green checkbox emoji. and when something isn't working right, or doesn't go the way you intended, use the red X emoji. If the output is simply informational, you can use the info emoji. Don't feel like every output needs an emoji, only use when appropriate.
